       <p>Nonprofit overview (January 2024- February 2024)</p>
       <p2>Halfway There Rescueâ€™s goal is to pull at risk pets from overcrowded shelters in North and South Carolina, place them in temporary foster homes and ultimately find them permanent, loving homes. We also offer a community outreach pro</p>

       <p>Why was a redesign needed ?</p>
       <p2>My team and I wanted to make the site simpler by creating new accessible links and buttons for users.
        There was a lack of donation link on this page making it hard to donate</p>
        <p>Starting with the basics</p>
        <p2>To start off our redesign we wanted to understand our target market. through gaining user insights and surveys we were able to consolidate all the information to   create a user persona</p>

        <p>Defining the flow</p>
        <p2>To define how a user can navigate halfway there rescue we performed a card sorting to determine how we can redesign this site for better usability,</p>

        <p>Wireframing</p>
        <p>After we completed our user flow, we then proceeded in creating our wireframes. we started with a low-fidelity prototype and further iteration to get a mid-fidelity prototype</p>

        <p>Final UI</p>
        <p2>after a couple of usability tests and iteration we were able to produce our final redesign using elements and colors from our style guide and mood board. we wanted the user to feel a sense of joy when visiting the site.</p2>
